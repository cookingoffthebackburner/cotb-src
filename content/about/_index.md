title = "About Cooking Off The Backburner"
+++

Welcome to our little niche where the off the cuff meets the everyday in cooking. We approach cooking from unique backgrounds, endless curiosity, limited resources, and bottomless hunger, and bring it all together here to share with our family and friends - old and new alike (yes, that includes you!). 

#### Why "Cooking Off The Backburner"?

A play on the idiom of putting something _on_ the backburner, we strive to take the opposite approach and bring to the fore unique aspects of cooking that may otherwise be underappreciated or go altogether unnoticed. 

More than that, we are a couple of people who, like most folks, also juggle daytime jobs, healthy habits, needy pets, family, nature outtings, and more. Given these constraints, we often approach our cooking in a way that asks us to get a little creative with our time and on-hand ingredients. Sometimes it fails spectacularly, and sometimes it succeeds in unexpected ways. We want to record and share our experiences as we explore how to (literally) cook off the backburner in a way that is fulfilling, healthy (ish at least!), and most of all, creative. That way, all of us together can be that much more confident in our cooking adventures.

#### Where Do You Get Your #inspo?

We will always give credit where credit is due, and promise that whenever we share recipes, techniques, or other aspects of cooking, we will strive to give proper attribution to our inspirations. 

Some of our favorite cornerstones who we look to for advice are [Serious Eats](https://seriouseats.com),[Bon Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/), [NY Times Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/), but we also follow the various individual contributors to these establishments. This however is just a smattering of our daily reads - we strive to follow a diverse crowd across all the various social channels so we get a wonderful spread of cooking insights.
